# Zen Garden — The Jellyfish

A jellyfish is calming, melodic and undulating. The slow-moving tentacles draw attention and are hypnotic. Relax the mind into the Zen state of _wuxin_. Jellyfish dominate the ocean. Not only can you find jellyfish in the sea, they are now covering the internet. As you can see, our team used a combination of jellyfish images, relaxing blue tones and a suspended light source. These blend perfectly to create a state of Zen to relax and unwind. 

The bullet points on the titles are made to look like baby jellyfish guiding our users to significant knowledge. On the background you can see a light source at the top and coral at the bottom. The experience moving to the bottom of the page is similar to a diver swimming to the ocean floor. Fascinating things can be found living in coral. Similarly, the coral of our page has links to new things to explore. There’s a blend of colors in the SVG image of the jellyfish. This is realistically what a diver would see as light illuminates one side of a jellyfish’s body. 

The typography for our website is simple. Our page shows two types of fonts San Serif and Script. This mixture is relaxing and easy to read. The center alignment is used the most to show the user key headings. In the right column you can see we switch to a left alignment. This shows separation from the main information yet draws a user’s eye proving it’s importance.

Spacing is precise between the headers and paragraphs. This shows the intimate relation while still putting emphasis on the headings. Special rounded borders are used on the side columns. This tells the user what information is separate from the main information while drawing subtle attention.  

Our team used Trello for project management and issue tracking. We were able to assign tasks accordingly. GitHub was a wonderful tool we implemented for source code control and hosting the final webpage. We practiced Agile methodologies appropriate for a project this size.

Since a jellyfish is calming it matches a Zen ambience perfectly. All of the elements combine to give the user a stress-free experience when they visit our website.
